While I am currently visiting family in the Portland area for Christmas I figure I will recount a quick story from the last time I was here.

It was Summer 2012 and I was at Stumptown Coffee Roasters in Portland, one of the locations attached to a trendy hotel (I recommend going to [Stumptown](http://stumptowncoffee.com) if you ever get a chance, it gets high recommendations from most coffee fans. They also brew stumptown&#8217;s roasted coffee in Vancouver, BC at [Revolver Coffee](http://revolvercoffee.ca)). The hotel lobby connects with the coffee shop and they seemed to be cool with letting us lounge there for a bit. While we were sitting a guy came and sat down in the corner of the L-shaped couch with his MacBook Pro. After getting a glance I felt he looked familiar and guessed I recognized him. I know it&#8217;s creepy but the curiosity got the best of me and I looked him up on and showed my sister and girlfriend his picture and they thought it kind of looked like him, too. I&#8217;m not sure if he noticed but I hope I didn&#8217;t make it too awkward. Anyways, after some deliberation I asked him if he was Joe Hewitt and he responded &#8220;Yes. Do I know you?&#8221;. I told him no, I was just a fan of his work and like to dabble with technology and the web. We had a short couple minute conversation before he had to meet up with someone else. I also asked him if he ever gets recognized and he said not outside the bay area, so I guess it&#8217;s not that common for developers despite how big their projects are. Oh, for those of you who don&#8217;t know who Joe Hewitt is he is guy behind the original _native_ Facebook App for iPhone, Firebug for Firefox, and apparently contributed towards Firefox itself. He runs an [interesting blog](http://joehewitt.com) and you can follow him on twitter: [@joehewitt](https://twitter.com/joehewitt), but both have been inactive for some time. It looks like he has some recent activity on github and has been working on a programming language called [Up](https://github.com/joehewitt/up).

Even though Joe Hewitt isn&#8217;t from Portland, it is a pretty neat city for technology, and has been given the nickname, with Seattle, of the _Silicon Forest. _I&#8217;ve stumbled across an [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com) office here and know that Panic, the guys behind Coda, are also somewhere in the city.
