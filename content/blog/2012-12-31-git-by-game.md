Not sure how I found out about [githug](https://github.com/Gazler/githug) but it&#8217;s a fun little game that familiarized me with git very quickly. Nothing beats having to do it in practice but this gets pretty close by setting up little challenges that mimic instances you&#8217;ll face while using git.

Along with this [git book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/), [git immersion guide](http://gitimmersion.com/), [git manual](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html)Â and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git), there are plenty of resources to get going with git. I still have lots to learn but git is proving to be an invaluable tool.
