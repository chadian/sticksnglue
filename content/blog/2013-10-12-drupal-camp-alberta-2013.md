So about three weeks ago I had the privilege to attend [Drupal Camp Alberta](http://drupalcampalberta.org "Drupal Camp Alberta"). This year the the guys from [Hybrid Forge](http://www.hybridforge.com "Hybrid Forge") (where I work!), organized and sponsored it. I really appreciated the hard work they put into making it a high calibre, and fun, and from the sounds of it others had a really great time, too. And it was in Banff! How could you not?! Looking out of the conference rooms to a wall full of glass, opening up into a valley of the Rocky Mountains, even deer were strolling down on the grass below.

So I'm not much of a Drupal guy, but I'm quickly learning the vocabulary (err, I mean terms), the setup, the infinite amount of modules and ways of tackling a problem. I'm hoping to dive more into the theming, and behind-the-scenes "guts" in the recent future. It won't be long before I'll have something to show here.

One thing that I had heard about, but which was made more apparent at Drupal Camp, was that people really love Drupal. The community _really_ stands behind Drupal, which is awesome because doing something because you love it is always the best reason, and that seems to speak to Drupal.
