If you're like me and you've relied on regex to quickly solve the odd search problem and string mashing, but haven't really made use of some of the shortcuts and optimizations,Â then I recommend giving this video a shot (thanks to smashing magazine for [tweeting this video](https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/326012584312569856)). She provides a decent breakdown behind the logic in tackling problems with regular expressions, including if you should use them at all. There's also skill testing questions throughout which are a fun challenge as you go.  
  
A few more resources to keep you going after the video:

  * [A handy cheat sheet](http://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/)
  * [Regular expressions book, with exercises](http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
  * [Regex source code if you're even more curious (scroll down a bit on page)](http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/string/regex/article.php/c2791/Using-Regular-Expressions-for-SearchReplace.htm)

If you have any regular expression resources / learning suggestions feel free to leave them in the comments. Thanks!

[Update]  
Found that [this tool](http://www.phpliveregex.com/) can be pretty handy for live testing, practicing regular expressions (specifically for PHP). Gives you the resulting function with parameters to use, too.
